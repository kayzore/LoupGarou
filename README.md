## Notes for compilation ##

- The following compilation warning is normal and can safely be ignored: `WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.comphenix.net.sf.cglib.core.ReflectUtils$1 (file:<path>) to method java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(java.lang.String,byte[],int,int,java.security.ProtectionDomain)`. It is due to the fact that [ProtocolLib currently does not support Java versions above Java 8 and won't until Mojang and Spigot decide to update.](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/issues/603#issuecomment-490207994)
